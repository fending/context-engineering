# Single CLAUDE.md File Approach

Four examples of single-file context at different levels of project complexity:

- **[minimal.md](minimal.md)** -- The smallest useful context file. Start here.
- **[saas-app.md](saas-app.md)** -- Full context for a multi-layer product with auth, data model, and API conventions.
- **[api-service.md](api-service.md)** -- Backend API with endpoint patterns, data layer rules, and integration points.
- **[cli-tool.md](cli-tool.md)** -- Command-line tool with exit codes, output formatting, and cross-platform concerns.

Each file shows the structure and explains what belongs in each section. Copy the one closest to your project and fill in your specifics.

*Note that you'll need to copy the middle section of the file enclosed in "````", saved as your CLAUDE.md.*

For guidance on when to graduate from a single file to a context directory or cascading pattern, see the [main README](../README.md#which-approach-should-you-use).
